# osu-switcher ![views](https://hits.seeyoufarm.com/api/count/incr/badge.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FDiamondMiner88%2Fosu-server-switcher&count_bg=%2379C83D&title_bg=%23555555&icon=github.svg&icon_color=%23E7E7E7&title=views&edge_flat=true)

- Switch between servers seamlessly with desktop shortcuts
- Switch accounts when switching servers (not multiaccounting)
- Prevent passwords being shared between servers
- Quickly relaunch osu! when opening with a different shortcut
- Auto-launch 3rd party server patchers (like the [akatsuki patcher](https://akatsuki.pw/patcher)) (**WIP**)

## Usage

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/DiamondMiner88/osu-switcher/releases/latest)
2. Double click run to set up shortcuts for multiple servers
3. Use the shortcuts on your desktop to launch osu!

## Drawbacks

- I will not sign my release binaries, so cope with Windows SmartScreen.
- Due to a bug you may have to sign-in **twice** before switching again to save your credentials. I cannot do anything
  about it.
- You cannot delete the executable after you've created the shortcuts.
- Shortcuts will have to be recreated if you've moved the location of:
    - osu! install directory
    - osu-switcher.exe
    - 3rd party patchers (soon)

## Disclaimer

This is NOT a tool for multiaccounting.
I am an [akatsuki](https://akatsuki.pw) player and find it very annoying to change accounts between servers.
This tool allows you to switch accounts *between* servers, not on the same server.
