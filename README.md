- Switch between servers seamlessly with desktop shortcuts (with custom icons)
- Switch accounts when switching servers (not multiaccounting)
- Prevent passwords being shared between servers
- Quickly relaunch osu!stable when opening with a different shortcut

## Usage

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/DiamondMiner88/osu-switcher/releases/latest)
2. Double click run to set up shortcuts for multiple servers
3. Use the shortcuts on your desktop to launch osu!

## Additional Info

- I don't sign my releases, Windows SmartScreen may appear on first launch.
- Due to an osu!stable bug you need to sign-in **twice** across different launches before your credentials for a
  specific server can be saved.
- Shortcuts will have to be recreated if you've moved the location of the following:
    - `osu!` install directory
    - `osu-switcher.exe`

## Disclaimer

This is NOT a tool for multiaccounting.
I am an [akatsuki](https://akatsuki.pw) player and find it very annoying to change accounts between servers.
This tool allows you to switch accounts *between* servers, not on the same server.
